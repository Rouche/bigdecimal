# bigdecimal
Disclaimer: Any of you, happen to find a bug and fix it. Please, send the fix here.

Its the only thing i ask. As always.

2009

This is a conversion of the IBM ICU implementation of the BigDecimal for ActionScript 3, (Flash or Flex) Compiled with SDK 3.2.0

Two files are needed, BigDecimal.as and MathContext.as You can also take BigDecimalTest.as if you need some testing.

Files are in the Source->Browse->Trunk.

Feel free to report bugs or errors if there are any.

Thanks.

OK We are in 2012 now

I no longer work with Flex.
Adobe never did any work to support such an important functionality in finance domain.

Removed a lot of the cursing from my original project :)

OK We are in 2015!

Might need this in TypeScript restored for future use.
